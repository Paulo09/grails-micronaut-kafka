Create a new Grails application for this additional app. For example by using
http://start.grails.org/[Grails Application Forge] or the command line:

[source,bash]
----
$ grails create-app example.grails.complete-analytics --profile=rest-api
----

For the multi app part of this guide we will need to be able to run both apps simultaneously. To avoid a running port conflict update your app's `application.yml` to include the following.

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/conf/application.yml[indent=0, tag=serverPort]
----

Create a Domain class `BookAnalytics` which will keep track of how many times a book has been viewed.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/domain/example/grails/BookAnalytics.groovy
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/domain/example/grails/BookAnalytics.groovy[]
----

Create a GORM Data service for this domain class:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/services/example/grails/BookAnalyticsGormService.groovy
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/services/example/grails/BookAnalyticsGormService.groovy[]
----

<1> Implement update operations using JPA-QL


Create a Controller which uses the previous service:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/example/grails/AnalyticsController.groovy
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/controllers/example/grails/AnalyticsController.groovy[]
----

Create two JSON Views: 

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/views/analytics/_bookAnalytics.gson
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/views/analytics/_bookAnalytics.gson[]
----

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/views/analytics/index.gson
----
include::complete-analytics/grails-app/views/analytics/index.gson[]
----

Create a new class to act as a consumer of the messages sent to Kafka by the books microservice. The Micronaut framework will implement logic to invoke the consumer at compile time. Create the `AnalyticsListener` class:


[source,groovy]
.src/main/groovy/example/grails/AnalyticsListener.groovy
----
include::complete-analytics/src/main/groovy/example/grails/AnalyticsListener.groovy[]
----

<1> Do not load this bean for the test environment - this lets us run the tests without having Kafka running
<2> Annotate the class with @KafkaListener to indicate that this bean will consume messages from Kafka
<3> Constructor injection for `BookAnalyticsGormService`
<4> Annotate the method with `@Topic` and specify the topic name to use
